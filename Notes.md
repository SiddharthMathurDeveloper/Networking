## Networks :
- A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

- Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media such as twisted pair of fiber optic cables or by wireless methods such as Wi-Fi microwave transmission or free-space optical communication.

  ### Why do we have computer networks?
 -  Big reason to have a network as per this definition is to share resources. We want to share information or share some      kind of resource with someone else.

  ### What is a resource ?
 - In the old days. A common example of a resource would be a printer. If you had an office with 100 people in the office 
  you could buy a printer for every workstation or for every PC And that's what they had to do before the days of 
  networking.

 - They either had to have a printer for every computer or have no printers or what they had to do is do , something like 
  this where they copy a file onto a floppy disk and then go over to the printing station and then print it manually.

 - It's not cost-effective to buy a printer for every workstation or for every person. It makes much more sense to have a 
  centralized resource in this case a printing resource and share that resource amongst the people in the office.

- So rather than having let's say 100 printers for 100 people you only let's say have 10 printers. So you've reduced the 
 cost by creating a shared resource a resource that can be shared by what are called clients.

- Now today we still use this kind of technology by using USB thumb drives. So if I wanted to share a resource with you like a photograph or a file I could copy it onto this USB drive and then give it to you and then you'd copy it to your computer.

- So sneakernet the original type of networking if you like is where a human being would take a resource copy of file or a photograph into this USB drive. I'd walk to your computer and then give it to you and share the resource with you.
But that's not very effective. It's not scalable doesn't work that well. You, let's be honest, most humans would be too lazy to have to walk around the office to share files.

***It's much easier just to share files using a digital transmission mechanism or medium and they're different types of digital transmission mechanisms.***
  

  ### What is node ?
  - And there are many types of computing devices. We could have Windows laptops. We could have Mac books.We could have         phones.We could have servers.

- Those are often the devices that most consumers will think about.

- But in networking, we have specialized devices such as hubs, switches, routers and firewalls to name a few.
