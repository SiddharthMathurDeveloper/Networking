## Networks :
- A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

- Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media such as twisted pair of fiber optic cables or by wireless methods such as Wi-Fi microwave transmission or free-space optical communication.

  ### Why do we have computer networks?
 -  Big reason to have a network as per this definition is to share resources. We want to share information or share some      kind of resource with someone else.

  ### What is a resource ?
 - In the old days. A common example of a resource would be a printer. If you had an office with 100 people in the office 
  you could buy a printer for every workstation or for every PC And that's what they had to do before the days of 
  networking.

 - They either had to have a printer for every computer or have no printers or what they had to do is do , something like 
  this where they copy a file onto a floppy disk and then go over to the printing station and then print it manually.

 - It's not cost-effective to buy a printer for every workstation or for every person. It makes much more sense to have a 
  centralized resource in this case a printing resource and share that resource amongst the people in the office.

- So rather than having let's say 100 printers for 100 people you only let's say have 10 printers. So you've reduced the 
 cost by creating a shared resource a resource that can be shared by what are called clients.

- Now today we still use this kind of technology by using USB thumb drives. So if I wanted to share a resource with you like a photograph or a file I could copy it onto this USB drive and then give it to you and then you'd copy it to your computer.

- So sneakernet the original type of networking if you like is where a human being would take a resource copy of file or a photograph into this USB drive. I'd walk to your computer and then give it to you and share the resource with you.
But that's not very effective. It's not scalable doesn't work that well. You, let's be honest, most humans would be too lazy to have to walk around the office to share files.

***It's much easier just to share files using a digital transmission mechanism or medium and they're different types of digital transmission mechanisms.***
  

  ### What is node ?
  - And there are many types of computing devices. We could have Windows laptops. We could have Mac books.We could have         phones.We could have servers.

- Those are often the devices that most consumers will think about.

- But in networking, we have specialized devices such as hubs, switches, routers and firewalls to name a few.

### Summary 

- Why do we have a computer network? 

- We want to share resources which could be a printer, could be a file, could be a video.

- So videos are very popular these days.

- You watching s video through a computer network I'm sharing  information with you using a data link

- In the Wikipedia definition. They talk about a data link being a physical cable such as twisted pair, fiber optic cables, Wi-Fi or some type of data link where I'm sharing information with you.

- So the big idea here is I'm sharing a resource with you and I need a way to get that to you. You need a device that can receive the resource, we need some kind of transmission media which could be physical cables or it could be wireless.

- So the idea is rather than having to physically transport a file on a USB drive or in the veryvery old days using a floppy disk we use a cable or some kind of mechanism to transmit data from one device to another or from one device to many devices.



## More About Networks :

- But a network doesn't have to be very big. A small network would simply consist of two computing device.
-  eg . So copy a file from this computer onto the drive and then put it into the second computer and then copy the file onto       this computer. So that's how I could share information from one computer to another without a network.

  ***But in its most basic form a computer network will use something like a cable , copper Ethernet cable.This is what's   called UTP or Unshielded Twisted Pair copper cable.You've probably come across these types of connectors in the real world.     This is known as an RJ45 connector.***

- Newer laptop and like a lot of newer laptops and Mac books it doesn't have any RJ45 Network ,it has NIC (Network Interface Cards)


## Network Interface Cards (NIC) :

<br/>

- Now a Network Interface Card or NIC is how we connect to the physical network or wireless network.It's basically a card that's either inserted into a laptop or is built into a laptop that has what's called a MAC address or Media Access Control address on Ethernet which is the technology that we generally use today or wireless devices are known by what's called a MAC address.

- If you don't have a Network Interface Card in your laptop you could use USB to Ethernet adapter like this.

So that would allow you to connect to the network using Ethernet or once again using wireless.

***You essentially need a way to get a node onto the network and a Network Interface Card is the way that you connect yourself to the Ethernet network. Remember we are transmitting data from one device to another using some kind of media which could be the air could be physical cabling.***





## MAC address or Media Access Control :

![Screenshot 2023-08-24 at 2 29 47 PM](https://github.com/SiddharthMathurDeveloper/Networking/assets/133037456/8e9e02a8-c607-4a2b-abd1-dcf0b92d9730) ![Screenshot 2023-08-24 at 2 32 54 PM](https://github.com/SiddharthMathurDeveloper/Networking/assets/133037456/f3f2702d-5785-4fd9-8ac0-f95dad2a0182)
<br/>

- A MAC address, or media access control address, is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device connected to the network.
- They are physically attached to the  hardware device / burned into it
  
- It is primarily specified as a unique identifier during device manufacturing and is often found on a device's network interface card (NIC).




## WiFi :
- Wi-Fi is an example of using the air for transmission of data from one device to the other makes life a lot easier
in many ways. People today expect that it's easy to share information from one device to another.

- They are used as a network address in communications within a network segment and are common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth

***Apple Airdrop creates it's own WiFi network that allows two devices to shares files without the need for any other
Wifi networks.***




## Server :
![Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 9 50 19 AM](https://github.com/SiddharthMathurDeveloper/Networking/assets/133037456/1004576c-01e7-4972-b566-7cbcf7ad81b3) <br/>


- In computing a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices called clients.
  This architecture is called the client server model and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or   
  devices.
  
- The whole idea of a server is to provide resources or functionality to clients. So this server is big because we want a lot of storage, we want a lot of computing power and a lot of memory in a server especially if we want to scale it up.

- If you've got thousands and thousands of queries from many many clients to a server you wanted to have the capacity so memory, CPU, storage to handle those queries. So hence big device. It needs to have the capacity to service the requests.

- So if only one or two people are requesting a web page from the server that's not a problem.But if we've got thousands and thousands of requests one server may not even be enough.

  ***And then we have distributed services. So we have a service such as a web page that's distributed across multiple servers.***

- Google as an example will have thousands upon thousands upon thousands of servers to service the requests from millions of clients. So they will have many many servers to service or provide a service to the clients. When you go to the Google Website and you type in a request that's querying databases and retrieving information from databases to give you a answer about some query that you've made.
  

- So the server is providing a service to a client.

- You don't need dedicated hardware like this to have a server a client device such as a laptop can act as a server.
  So the role will determine how that device is acting. A physical laptop such as this laptop could be a client requesting a service   from a server but it could also be hosting a service

- So it may be running some kind of server and then sharing a file as an example with a another PC, so it's hosting a file sharing   service. <br/>
![Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 9 53 15 AM](https://github.com/SiddharthMathurDeveloper/Networking/assets/133037456/8bdb6b04-906a-4b05-b294-77adff5f760c) <br/>

-  So clients access servers to make use of a service that the server is providing. A website will serve a web page to a client which is then displayed on your computer as an example.

- Server / Computing device / one physical computer will be listening on different port numbers for different protocols.

- A computer server is listening on specific port numbers. If you want to get a web page your browser is automatically configured or programmed to talk to port 80(Http) or to port for 443(Https).

 ***So notice a server is providing a service or functionality to clients in what's called a client server model.***


## Client :

- A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server.The server is often on another computer system in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network /across a network



## Client - Server Model :
![Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 10 12 53 AM](https://github.com/SiddharthMathurDeveloper/Networking/assets/133037456/84e59b05-2c63-4514-8569-73c8ff30e596)<br/>
- So a server can run multiple services and provide multiple services to clients / client requests something from a server the server provides the file or the service to the client this is called  client-server model 




## Protocols :
- It's basically a set of rules used for communication between devices

- As an example I'm speaking English here.Hopefully, you can hear what I'm saying and hopefully, you can understand what I'm saying because I'm using a set of conventions in my speech. So in English we speak a certain way. As an example some languages will use numbers differently to English. The protocol that we are speaking here is English so I will say 21 but in a different language like
Afrikaans I'll say een-en-twintig which is basically saying one two to denote 21.So the way that words are pronounced or the way that numbers are pronounced is reversed in a different language to English.

- The point is you and I are using a specific protocol we are listening to English as the transmission and you can understand what I'm saying. But if I switched my language or my protocol and started saying goeie more uhanet fan da, you might struggle to understand me unless you understand South African.

***The point is is that a server doesn't just automatically switch like we do in our brains from one language to another.It has to listen on specific port numbers.***

- Your ears are listening on the same frequencies for both English and Afrikaans then your brain just switches from one language to     another

- A server is not as clever as that. It has to listen on specific port numbers for specific protocols.
