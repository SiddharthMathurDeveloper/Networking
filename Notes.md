## Networks :
- A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

- Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media such as twisted pair of fiber optic cables or by wireless methods such as Wi-Fi microwave transmission or free-space optical communication.

  ### Why do we have computer networks?
 -  Big reason to have a network as per this definition is to share resources. We want to share information or share some      kind of resource with someone else.

  ### What is a resource ?
 - In the old days. A common example of a resource would be a printer. If you had an office with 100 people in the office 
  you could buy a printer for every workstation or for every PC And that's what they had to do before the days of 
  networking.

 - They either had to have a printer for every computer or have no printers or what they had to do is do , something like 
  this where they copy a file onto a floppy disk and then go over to the printing station and then print it manually.

 - It's not cost-effective to buy a printer for every workstation or for every person. It makes much more sense to have a 
  centralized resource in this case a printing resource and share that resource amongst the people in the office.

- So rather than having let's say 100 printers for 100 people you only let's say have 10 printers. So you've reduced the 
 cost by creating a shared resource a resource that can be shared by what are called clients.

- Now today we still use this kind of technology by using USB thumb drives. So if I wanted to share a resource with you like a photograph or a file I could copy it onto this USB drive and then give it to you and then you'd copy it to your computer.

- So sneakernet the original type of networking if you like is where a human being would take a resource copy of file or a photograph into this USB drive. I'd walk to your computer and then give it to you and share the resource with you.
But that's not very effective. It's not scalable doesn't work that well. You, let's be honest, most humans would be too lazy to have to walk around the office to share files.

***It's much easier just to share files using a digital transmission mechanism or medium and they're different types of digital transmission mechanisms.***
  

  ### What is node ?
  - And there are many types of computing devices. We could have Windows laptops. We could have Mac books.We could have         phones.We could have servers.

- Those are often the devices that most consumers will think about.

- But in networking, we have specialized devices such as hubs, switches, routers and firewalls to name a few.

### Summary 

- Why do we have a computer network? 

- We want to share resources which could be a printer, could be a file, could be a video.

- So videos are very popular these days.

- You watching s video through a computer network I'm sharing  information with you using a data link

- In the Wikipedia definition. They talk about a data link being a physical cable such as twisted pair, fiber optic cables, Wi-Fi or some type of data link where I'm sharing information with you.

- So the big idea here is I'm sharing a resource with you and I need a way to get that to you. You need a device that can receive the resource, we need some kind of transmission media which could be physical cables or it could be wireless.

- So the idea is rather than having to physically transport a file on a USB drive or in the veryvery old days using a floppy disk we use a cable or some kind of mechanism to transmit data from one device to another or from one device to many devices.



## More About Networks :

- But a network doesn't have to be very big. A small network would simply consist of two computing device.
-  eg . So copy a file from this computer onto the drive and then put it into the second computer and then copy the file onto       this computer. So that's how I could share information from one computer to another without a network.

  ***But in its most basic form a computer network will use something like a cable , copper Ethernet cable.This is what's   called UTP or Unshielded Twisted Pair copper cable.You've probably come across these types of connectors in the real world.     This is known as an RJ45 connector.***

- Newer laptop and like a lot of newer laptops and Mac books it doesn't have any RJ45 Network ,it has NIC (Network Interface Cards)


## Network Interface Cards (NIC) :

<br/>

- Now a Network Interface Card or NIC is how we connect to the physical network or wireless network.It's basically a card that's either inserted into a laptop or is built into a laptop that has what's called a MAC address or Media Access Control address on Ethernet which is the technology that we generally use today or wireless devices are known by what's called a MAC address.




## MAC address or Media Access Control

<br/>

- A MAC address, or media access control address, is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device connected to the network.
- They are physically attached t oa hardware device / burned into it
  
- It is primarily specified as a unique identifier during device manufacturing and is often found on a device's network interface card (NIC).




## WiFi :
- Wi-Fi is an example of using the air for transmission of data from one device to the other makes life a lot easier
in many ways. People today expect that it's easy to share information from one device to another.

- They are used as a network address in communications within a network segment and are common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth

***Apple Airdrop creates it's own WiFi network that allows two devices to shares files without the need for any other
Wifi networks.***
